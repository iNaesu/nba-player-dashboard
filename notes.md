# Todo
* Use transition instead of animation for the circular stat progress bars:
    * Make those components presentational - stateless
    * This means they will be functions instead of classes

* Add interactivity - New branch
    * On page load, fetch leaguewide data from mysportsfeed
    * From leaguewide data, determine league leader & league average
    * Randomly pick a current player from a list
    * Get the player's stats
    * Get list of 3 similar players using leaguewide stats
    * Get photos of current player & similar players (think about timeout)
    * Rerender the app. Make sure the whole app rerenders at the same time

# Additional features
* Tooltips and animation on hover on graphs
* Add player number to Profile card
